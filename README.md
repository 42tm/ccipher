# `ccipher`
###### An utility to decrypt and encrypt plain ASCII text in several classical ciphers.

## Installation 
- Get prebuilt binaries from [Releases](https://github.com/42tm/ccipher/releases) page
- ...or build yourself an executable in the platform of your choice.

## Build
### Requirements
`ccipher` requires `cmake` and a C++11-compatible compiler to be available inside your `PATH` environment variable.
  
  To test whether you have it : 
  - Fire up a terminal.
  - Enter `cmake --version` to test CMake. On GNU/Linux it should yields a result like this :
    ```
    cmake version 3.12.1

    CMake suite maintained and supported by Kitware (kitware.com/cmake).
    ```
  - Enter `g++ -v` to test GCC suite. On GNU/Linux, you should see something like this :
    ```
    Using built-in specs.
    COLLECT_GCC=g++
    COLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/8/lto-wrapper
    OFFLOAD_TARGET_NAMES=nvptx-none
    OFFLOAD_TARGET_DEFAULT=1
    Target: x86_64-linux-gnu
    Configured with:
    ...
    Thread model: posix
    gcc version 8.2.0 (Debian 8.2.0-5)
    ```
    
  - (Only if `g++` isn't there)
    
    Type `clang++ -v` or `clang++ --version` to check if Clang is available.
    It should yields things like
    ```
    clang version 6.0.1-6
    Target: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
    ...
    ```
  - If you fail to successfully run any command of the above, see section "Fulfilling requirements" below.

### Compiling instruction  
- Fire up a terminal.
- Change the current directory to be the root of this repository.
  - `git clone https://github.com/42tm/ccipher` beforehand, if necessary.
- Make a directory there. Here I assume you used a directory called `build/`.
- Change current directory to it.
- Enter the following commands:

  ```bash
  cmake .. # Create Makefile
  ```

  - There are 2 options to build:
    - Release: `-O3`
    ```
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    ```
    - Debug: `-g`
    ```
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
    ```

> By default, when run `cmake ..` without specific build type, 
> - If no build option was chosen in the past, cmake will try to build this repo 
>   in Release
> - Else cmake will select last build type

- There should be `Makefile` for you after running CMake. Now run it:

```
make
```

Now you should see an executable named `ccipher` inside your current directory
(or `ccipher.exe` in case you use Windows).

### Fulfilling requirements
- CMake : download from [here](https://cmake.org/download/).
- C++-11 compatible compiler : 
  - On Windows, try Clang or MinGW-w64.
  - On GNU/Linux, try any compiler you want.
